This script was built to help streamline adding tags to my teams ESRI enterprise portal content. We wanted to condense the number of groups in our organization and by doing that we needed a way to reorganize our content. This script allows a user to search for the portal items, remove them if needed and add tags to the items. Team members didn't have to do tags on individual items in a browser any more.
